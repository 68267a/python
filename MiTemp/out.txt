---------------------------------------------


Please read README.md in this folder. Latest version is available at https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2#readme
This file explains very detailed about the usage and covers everything you need to know as user.


Script started in passive mode
------------------------------
In this mode all devices within reach are read out, unless a devicelistfile and --onlydevicelist is specified.
Also --name Argument is ignored, if you require names, please use --devicelistfile.
In this mode debouncing is not available. Rounding option will round humidity and temperature to one decimal place.
Passive mode usually requires root rights. If you want to use it with normal user rights,
please execute "sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip $(eval readlink -f `which python3`)"
You have to redo this step if you upgrade your python version.
